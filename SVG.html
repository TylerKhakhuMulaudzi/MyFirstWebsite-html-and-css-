	<h2><u>Goku V Superman</u></h2>

	<p> In the anime community this is a commmon question that people debate about and it is still being asked today, However we'll be looking into a diiffrent perspective whereas most people will be discussing who will be the victor in a battle between the two, I will be looking at the cultural perspective of these two characters that have impacted their respective worlds.</p>
<br>

	<h2 id="GvS"><u>Goku:</u></h2>
	<div>
		<p id="Goku"></p>
	</div>
	<p>Born( 3rd December 1984) on the planet Vegeta and sent aways juss as an infant due to planet vegeta neing destroyed, Goku was sent to earth where he was adopted by is Adopted father Gohan ,Goku was then trained in martail Arts and befriended people who would all become proctors of the world.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 id="GvS2"><u>Superman:</u></h2>
		<div>
			<p id="Superman"></p>
		</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Born in the on the planet krypton Kal-El(original birth name)was sent to earth due to the fact the their planet was also about to be detsrtoyed by a natural cataclysm therafter he aws found amd adopted by the farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent naming Kal-Ela Clark Kent and growing he woould soon discover that he had specail abilities .</p>
<br>
	<h2><u>Their contrasting Values and Needs</u></h2>
	<p>Thes two characters meet diiferent cultural corncerns whie Superman represnts a final standing force that is good he is able to right any wrongs and provides reading and viewiers with comfort tha he will save the day while Son Goku represnts infintitte potentail for personal growth and improvement he represents responsibility and limits which serves as a connection to the readers and views where we as humans have our own limits that seem unconquerable.</p>

	<p>Superman is described as the imbodyment of the american  spirit and ways as Julian Chambliss states " The core narritve in Superman has been and still contines to be the values and belief about the U.S. experince being strong enough and good enoughto address the troubles facing the genaretion engaged with the character " this results in him not really depending or needing anyone to help him take down villians compare to Son Goku who relies on his friends in order to become victorious with his battles and imbodies the confucian ideals of community in addition, requires assistance from others in order to reach a higher level of ability. As a result Supermans affirms the american world view of justice, individual merit and truth while Son Goku affirms the japanses focus on family, communit and self improvement. </p>
<br>
	<h2><u>Personas and their roles in their community</u></h2>
	<p>In Supermans community he hides his identity in order for him not to draw attention and indanger his clostest friends thus the persona of fumbly Clark Kent just as we oursevles in todays community wear socail mask when we are out in public and potray an imagge that we are alright and emotinally or mentally compared to Son Goku who lacks persina and who is simply a father and a member of the community. He is the type of person thatrelies on his friends and they rely on him as a resullt of this Son Goku is his own person and doesnt follow the ways of American indiviidualism who is unlike Clark kent this makes Son Goku more admirable. </p>

<br>

	<h2><u>Manga Vs comics </u></h2>
	<p>Theres a distint diffrence between comics nad manga and to beginng with this we'l be explaining <b>:</b>
	</p>
<br>
	<h2 id="GvS3"><u>Format and Distribution:</u></h2>
	<p>When it comes to manga it is sold in wither tankbun(book) or in a weekly magazine and there are usally printed out in black and white and are often clunky compared to american comics that are usally sold as magzines with color there are also collectors editions. Similar to manga series they come in a variety of options between individuals collections.</p>

	<h2 id="GvS4"><u>Print and publishing: </u></h2>
	<p>japnese manga are printed weekly in which allows for someone to read multiple stories and chapteres of manga while in american comics each comics takes time to produced and publish one comic(usally takes week/weeks or a month) though each comic dives into more detail than manga.</p>

	<h2 id="GvS5"><u>characters:</u></h2>
	<p>Another thing to notice the diffrence between comics and manga is that characters in manga constatly get stronger while comic book characters always retain  the same level of strenghten but in order for comic book charcters to get strong isnt perment</p>

	<h2 id="GvS6"><u>American comics Heros Vs japnese manga heros(longevity):</u></h2>
	<p>In order to able to explain this well i'll be comparing one character from both manga and comic books<b>:</b></p>
		<dl>
			<dt id="Luffy"><u>Captain America Vs Monkey D. Luffy:</u></dt>
			<dd id="cap">
				Captain America first apperance was in 1941 and still this day ther are people that are going out and purchasing his comics this is because in the comic world if the comic series become stagnant there are things that can be done  like it can be rebooted in which it can recive a positve or negative response to comic readers compared to manga the manga character Monkey D. Luffy who debuted in 1997 and ongoing to this day without any redoing nor rebooting.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<h2 id="GvS7"><u>Story Arcs:</u></h2>
		<p>In manga thier story arc can span for a long period of time either with each chapter introducing a new and tougher threat to deal with in order for the main characters to come out victorious some chapters are just chapters in which characters have fun with each other(fillers) thus allowing the manga to have a long story arcs compared to american comic book characters in which they have a shared universe with each other meaning that one characters outcome may effect the other characters within that universe while japnese mangaa are printed weekly which means that theres no overlapiing however in any perspective you look at it, manga and comic books are filled with interesting stories and strong themes </p>
