	<h1><u>The Dark Side of anime</u></h1>
	<br>
	<p>In todays world anime has to be seen as one of the most succesful entertainment of our youth however the reality behind the onscreen magic suffer in finace, working condition and can even lead to sucide reason being:</p>

	<br>
	<p>Anime is mostly drawn by hand and it takes skill and experince to create hand drawn animation and in such short span of time.
		Theres a talent shortage in the anime world which is a serious problem because of 200 animated seiries going on there aren't enough skilled labour pool to choose from.
		Studio often rely heavly on freelancers due to the fact that they dont have to pay for medical benefits and allocate them deadines that arent reasonable,
		Entry level animators(usally freelance aanimators) are the ones who make individual drawings after the directors producese a story board and middle-tier animators draw the important frames in the animation and
		In-between animators earn around 200 yen per paper drawing which is the equivelant amount to $2 however that would mean that a person would have to produce nearly 200 drawings a day but a single paper take more than an hour to produce.
		Animators working codition arent pleasing to work in which many animators have often fallen alseeo at their desk and some have been hospitalized multiple times due to exhaustion caused illenesses.Some studios even go so far to violate labour codes by workiing almost 400hours per month and go 37 days without a day off in one instance one animator committed sucide due to the fact that he had worked more than 600hours in a month in which this instance was classified as "work-related incident".
	</p>
	<P>There is a vast amount of capital that is poring into the anime community however just a little has been contributed to the annimators.Anime business has seen growth and neaarly every animation studio has been booked solid for a year in advance due to the fact that a number of household have watched anime on streaming services  </P>
