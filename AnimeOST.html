  <h1><u>Anime Songs:</u></h1>
<br>
  <p>
    Songs play a major role in Anime in the form of anime openings and ending as a result the  drama is intensified and due to the fact we living in this day and age of technology being part of our daily lives adults and whom just discovered anime are now being introduced to japanese music and culture as a whole.</p>
<br>
    <p>Released in junuary 1963, Astro boy was the first anime to have Opening music in which the anime was the most popular anime in japan during that time however it was not until the the 70s were anime songs started blooming and the reaseoning being were <a><u>Mitsuko HORIE</u></a> that sang for an anime show called Judo Boy not so long after there were japansese artist that started joining in and creating opening and closing anime songs.
  </p>
<br>
      <h2>Its Impact:</h2>
  <br>
      <p>These anime opening and ending songs have impacted anime to the point where they have become a one of main ingrident that makes anime and not only that it also becomes a symbol on its own and being part of the audince you able to remeber a particular anime just by playing either its opening or ending song in addition the impact of anime songs didnt just stop with just that infact in some anime they include theme songs for specific characters for example in the anime series naruto shippuden charcters like ithachi uchiha and a group called the akusti have their own theme in order for theme to have a more impact to the audince that are wacthing the anime show and making that theme song a stand as a symbol for that character</p>
      <br>
          <p>Japanse artist are finding an increasing fanbase of their musc outisde their country while in todays world everthing has to be digital so there isnt a high demand in physical sales because they arent that popular like they used to be however in music channels anime is one of the most listened to genre thus attracting those major music channels to japanses music and upload their songs into their systems and even go so far into creating playlist or asking the compsosers of the anime to create a playlist based of the anime or that resinate with the anime episode these playlist come from anime series  coming from "Attack on Titan" and "JOJO bizarre adventure"However ,Its not just anime playlist its n and anime opening have had a huge impact one example would be the"TK from ling tosite sigure" with the opening song from the anime "Tokyo Ghoul" "unravel" in which in nine months the song was streamed on spotify "11.6 million times on spotify and the most monthly listeners are US citizens </p>
        <br>
          <p>In addition due to the fact that anime has been gaining popularity japansese artists are simply using anime as a bridge to branch out into international audince however this might not work for most japanese artist due to the fact that if the audince doents like the opening song of the anime they can simply skip the song thus result in those artist not being able to gain that much of a popularity pool outside their country. </p>
